## Background 
Airplane is one of the favourite transportation options for some people, whether business purpose or vacation. Buying airplane tickets as preparation when traveling is a common activity to obtain the right airfare. However, the airfare is sometimes difficult to predict. Price with the same date and the same airline can have different price when we book today compared to tomorrow.

As a Data Scientist, We can build a machine learning model as a solution. The model can help to calculate and to predict airfare as accurately as possible. Hopefully, this model can be useful for travelers when planning their budget. In addition, this model also can help airlines to determine new competitive prices.


## Goals
Create a predictive model that able to predict airfare based on the dataset features.


## Dataset
The dataset can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/nikhilmittal/flight-fare-prediction-mh). The file used is __Data_Train.xlsx__ containing 10683 rows and 11 columns.


## Steps
1. Data Preparation
2. Data Pre-Processing and Feature Engineering
    - Handling Missing Value
    - Formatting Data
    - Extracting New Features 
    - Removing Unnecesary Feature
    - Handling Outliers
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Modeling
    - Ridge
    - K-Nearest Neighbor Regressor
    - Random Forest Regressor
5. Model Evaluation & Model Comparison
